# Task Schedule

This app aims to help keep user's schedules on the line and don't have more tasks than users can do in time. Moreover, requesters will see how long a task will take and when a user will start and end the task.

We use auto estimation tools to find approximate task duration with the ability to adjust duration later by its assignee. This will help users speed up their work, without switching to task estimation. Users can change their estimation before confirming a task.

The flow is simple:
- A user registers in the system and sets his working hours window.
- A requester user requests an assignee user to do a task, and then the system creates the task and estimates it. 
- The assignee, confirms the task and the system calculates the start and end dates for the task based on the current assignee schedule and working window and notifies the requester.
